<h1>COVY- The COVID 19 helping bot (Self designed)</h1>

A name is more than just a word, naming your own designed stuff brings a feeling of affinity. 
All the projects till date have a specific name according to their native language, their 
capabilities or purpose they serve. While designing the this bot I came up with the name COVY. 
The name is actually of Irish origin meaning "victorious". Variously spelled Covy and Covey. 
Also the named sounds similar to the COVID 19 pandemic hence reflecting the need to be 
designed.

Covy- The COVID helping Bot, is a technology designed for the Covid 19 virus awareness. 
The software takes user input through the keyboard , while the voice output takes place at the 
speaker. It is a combination of several different technologies: Graphical User Interface, voice 
analysis and text to speech conversion

<h2> Tools & Technology Used</h2>
Python
Python Libraries 
Tkinter
Matplotlib
Pyttsx3
Covid


<h2> Work Done</h2>
This project is a GUI inbuilt with a text to speech convertor using pyttsx3 (text to speech 
convertor) That can be installed in a bot. The program converts the Covid 19 spread 
prevention instruction in text format into speech.

The overall Interface is divided into three sections: 
Getting Data of individual countries.
